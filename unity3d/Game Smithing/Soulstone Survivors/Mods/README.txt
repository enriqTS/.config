If you want to use a community skin, you can use the in-game UI which is found under Main Menu -> Characters (top bar) -> Appearances (right panel) -> Community Skins.
If you prefer to download your community skin from somewhere, just place the folder under Skins/Characters/ or Skins/Weapons/ (create the folders if necessary).

If you want to create your own community skin, follow the instructions below:

## To get started, we've prepare some template files. Just unzip Skins.zip onto this folder and follow one of our guides above.
## After unzipping, you should have a folder structure such as ../Mods/Skins/Characters and ../Mods/Skins/Weapons. If you have something like ../Mods/Skins/Skins/Characters, move the folders.
## Once unzip, you should see a new weapon and character skin available in game.
